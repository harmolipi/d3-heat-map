# D3 Heat Map

Created as part of [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org) curriculum.

## Functionality

This is the [Heat Map](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/data-visualization/data-visualization-projects/visualize-data-with-a-heat-map) project, where I pull data from an API and visualize it in a heat map with the D3 library.

## Thoughts

Admittedly this was a real tough one for me. Before diving into it, not a lot of advice was given as far as diving into this sort of challenge goes, so I had no idea where to start. I managed to get going, and some more of the concepts started to make sense, but I did have to lean heavily on the code of the sample project to get it to work.

Between writing my own code and borrowing some ideas from the sample, I was able to get through most of it, but couldn't get test #9 to pass. I then realized my months weren't displaying properly, and so I had to tweak them a bit. Eventually, fortunately, it all started working!

God bless.
