# D3 Heat Map

Created as part of [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org) curriculum.

View on [Github](https://github.com/harmolipi/d3-heat-map).

## Functionality

This is the [Heat Map](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/data-visualization/data-visualization-projects/visualize-data-with-a-heat-map) project, where I pull data from an API and visualize it in a heat map with the D3 library.

## Thoughts
